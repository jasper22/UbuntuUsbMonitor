Note this package includes three build systems each with different targets:

 * SCons is used for development, there is minimal auto-configuration, one
   SConstruct script per target compiler and platform.

 * Autoconf is used for Unix-only library release.

 * CMake is used for Windows-only library release and installer packaging.
